Tolk is a "do the right thing" tool for transpiling. It reads a file from the file system, transpiles it with the available transpilers, inlines sourcemaps and autoprefixes css.

Returns a promise that resolves with the resulting transpiler output.

Installing the individual transpilers tolk should use is up to the consumer. There are no transpiler dependencies out of the box. So if you only need babel and sass, install `babel` and `node-sass`.

Tolk is useful for tools that handle precompiling for you, but might also be used directly in your task runner of preference in order to skip some of the many plugins that do the same but worse.

**Current precompiler support:** `LiveScript`, `babel`, `coco`, `coffee-script`, `dogescript`, `less`, `marked`, `myth`, `node-sass`, `stylus`, `swig`


Usage
-----

```
npm install tolk
```

Out of the box this will only give you CSS autoprefixing. In order to do more, for example babel and sass, also do this:

```
npm install node-sass babel
```

Now you are ready to start reading files from the file system. Tolk automatically loads the transpilers it has access to in the scope it is run in.

```js
var tolk = require('tolk');

tolk('path/to/stylesheet.scss').done(function (compiled) {
  // compiled.result is compiled, sourcemapped and autoprefixed CSS
  console.log(compiled.result);
}, function (err) {
  // In case anything failed
  throw err;
});

tolk('path/to/Reactcomponent.jsx').done(function (compiled) {
  // compiled.result is compiled ES6 with source maps
  console.log(compiled.result);
}, function (err) {
  // In case anything failed
  throw err;
});
```
